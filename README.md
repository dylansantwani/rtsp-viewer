RTSP Viewer. <br>
I am using this viewer with a Raspi 4 and a webcam to create a security interface.<br>
Source code in master branch, exe in main <br>
<strong>Easy Setup</strong><br>
Download the release folder and run SoftwareHub.exe<br>
<strong>Documentation</strong><br>
For security, modify VIDEO_URL in Form1.cs to change the default rtsp. Set visibility of all else to false to use as security monitor.<br>
All code inside folder - DO NOT MESS WITH DESIGN. YOU WILL BREAK THE DESIGN FILE.
Everything is ran inside Form1 - Default enter URL set to non visible - change as you will.
You can also update and customize the camera name of the software. In Form1.cs, edit the default (assignment) value of the string CAMNAME. <br>
This name will appear in the bottom left. <br>
This software is adjustable based on the size of your screen. <br>
Email me at dylansantwani@gmail.com or server@mail.xnetapp.com if you have any questions about the software. <br>
