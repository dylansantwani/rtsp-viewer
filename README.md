RTSP Viewer. <br>
I am using this viewer with a Raspi 4 and a webcam to create a security interface.<br>
Source code in master branch, exe in main <br>
<strong>Documentation</strong><br>
For security, modify VIDEO_URL in Form1.cs to change the default rtsp. Set visibility of all else to false to use as security monitor.<br>
All code inside folder - DO NOT MESS WITH DESIGN. YOU WILL BREAK THE DESIGN FILE.
Everything is ran inside Form1 - Default enter URL set to non visible - change as you will. <br>
Mit Licence - Use freely
